# POI cam view #
As fan of tv series [Person of Interest](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839578/), I've developed this small script, to 
do face detection from pc camera just as it is done on the show.
To try it type the following on terminal
* python cam.py \<PNGFILE\>


## Requirements ##
The following are required to run cam.py:
* Python 2.7.9
* OpenCV library for python (from terminal apt-get install python-opencv)
